# Raycasting and Gravity Simulation using SDL üéÆ

## Overview üìå
This project demonstrates a **raycasting simulation with gravity effects**, implemented using **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)** in C. The simulation features a primary circle casting rays, interacting dynamically with another moving circle under gravity, creating an engaging visual effect.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Raycasting System**: A central circle emits `400` rays that dynamically interact with objects.
- **Gravity Physics**: Circles experience acceleration due to gravity and bounce upon collision.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Move circles by dragging the mouse.
- **Dynamic Color Transition**: Smooth color transitions for a visually appealing effect.

## Code Breakdown üìñ
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Struct Definitions
#### **Circle Structure**
```c
struct Circle {
    double x, y, r, vy, BOUNCE_DAMPING;
};
```
- `x, y`: Position of the circle.
- `r`: Radius of the circle.
- `vy`: Velocity along the Y-axis (gravity effect).
- `BOUNCE_DAMPING`: Controls bounce energy loss.

#### **Line Structure**
```c
struct Line {
    double x1, y1, x2, y2;
};
```
- Represents a line segment using two points.

#### **RGB Color Structure**
```c
struct RGB {
    uint8_t r, g, b;
};
```
- Defines colors for rendering elements.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Circle Drawing Algorithm
```c
void DrawCircle(SDL_Surface* surface, struct Circle* c, struct RGB* rgb)
```
- Renders a filled circle using **pixel-by-pixel** rendering.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Line Drawing Algorithm (Bresenham's Line Algorithm)
```c
void DrawLine(SDL_Surface* surface, struct Line* line, struct RGB* rgb, struct Circle* col_c, int count)
```
- Implements **Bresenham‚Äôs Line Algorithm** for efficient line rendering.
- Checks for intersections with the moving circle.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Raycasting Mechanism
```c
void CastRay(SDL_Surface* surface, struct Circle* c, struct Line* l, struct RGB* color, struct Circle* col_c, int count)
```
- Casts rays in **all directions** from the central circle.
- Each ray extends up to `WIDTH + BLEED` pixels.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Gravity and Physics Simulation
```c
if (circle.y + circle.r < HEIGHT) {
    circle.vy += GRAVITY * TIME_STEP;
    circle.y += circle.vy;
} else {
    circle.y = HEIGHT - circle.r;
    circle.vy = -circle.vy * circle.BOUNCE_DAMPING;
}
```
- Simulates gravity on both circles.
- Implements **bounce damping** to reduce energy loss upon hitting the ground.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Event Handling (Mouse Interaction)
```c
if (e.type == SDL_MOUSEMOTION && e.motion.state != 0) { }
```
- Allows the user to drag circles using the mouse.
